                <h2>IP Address Hidding / Hiddining</h2>

                <p>
                    During Security Tests, sometimes we are not sure of our privacy on the Internet and want to be anonymous, so we will have to hide our Ip address.

                <h2>What's IP Address?</h2>

                <p>
                    Each device that connects or can be connected to the Internet has an ID (ip address). All the activities we do on the Internet can be detected and observed through our ip addresses. But in some cases, we can avoid this and ask that our movements are not observed.

                <h2>Tor</h2>
                <p>
                    What is Tor? Tor, aka "The Onion Routing", was developed in the 90s in order to support the American Navy and intelligence services. The purpose of Tor is to encrypt messages and ensure that other people do not decrypt these messages. Tor makes it impossible to change your Ip and connect to multiple and different servers from anywhere in the World and be tracked. Although tor is usually used to access the Deep web, we can also use it to become anonymous, which is the main task of the tor service. To download and use Tor, we also open terminal and enter the following commands on the command line. But to download it, you will first need to be root. If you don't know how to become root <b><a href="../Kali Linux/kali-linux-how-to-become-root.html"target="_blank">"How to become a Kali Linux root nail"</a></b> can you check out our title?
                </p>

                <code>' apt install tor '</code>
                <p class="text-continue">
                    To run it after downloading, also go to terminal;
                </p>
                <code>' service tor start '</code>
                <p class="text-continue-2">
                    After typing it, you have run it and now you have changed your IP address once. These commands also apply to termux. Of course, this is just one of the ways to change the Rope. You can also change it via the Tools. To stop;
                </p>
                <code>' service tor stop '</code>
                <p>
                    It will be enough for you to write it down.

                <h2>Torghost</h2>
                <p>
                    Torghost also changes your Ip address, just like tor, but it does this every 10 minutes to ensure that you leave no trace, making it impossible to track your steps. To install the Torghost tool, simply type the following commands into terminal, respectively.
                </p>
                <code>' apt install git '</code><br>
                <code>' apt install pip3 '</code><br>
                <code>' apt install python3 '</code><br>
                <code>' git clone <a href="https://github.com/SusmithKrishnan/torghost.git" target="_blank">https://github.com/SusmithKrishnan/torghost.git</a> '</code>
                <p>
                    After installing it, you are still typing the following commands to run it.
                </p>
                <code>' cd torghost/ '</code><br>
                <code>' pip3 install -r requirements.txt '</code><br>
                <code>' python3 torghost -s '</code>
                <p>
                    It will start working after typing, respectively. And it needs to stop;
                </p>
                <code>' python3 torghost -x</code>
                <p>
                    It will be enough for you to enter the command. Of course, these are exactly the same for termux.

                <h2>ProxyChains</h2>
                <p>
                    However, in some cases, you may want to protect your anonymity in 99% way by going through dozens of Ip addresses at the same time. For this purpose, we can use the ProxyChains (Proxy Chain) tool. Using ProxyChains may seem a click more difficult than other methods; because you will have to use active IP addresses every time. You can also use ProxyChains to;
                </p>
                <code>' locate proxychains '</code>
                <p>
                    You will need to type the first one from the directories you come across. 
                </p>
                <code>' sudo vi /etc/proxychain.conf '</code>
                <p>
                    We log in to the directory by typing the command. I have an underlined index that you see above, but you may have a different index. Then I delete the charp (#) icon of dynamic_chains and add a charp (#) to the very beginning of strict_chain, and then scroll down and come to the list under the name [ProxyList]. Here you are entering the active proxy that you received next to the socks4, socks5 or http proxy you can find by searching for it on the internet. I'm spys.i'll get it from one site, you can get it too. After receiving the proxy, you can enter it as in the following example.
                </p>
                <code>' #socks4 85.110.110.120:4444 '</code>
                <p>
                    You can enter an ip address and a port, as in the example, of course, you can use more than one proxy. This makes your steps even more difficult to follow.
