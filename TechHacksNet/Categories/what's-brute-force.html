                <h2>What is Brute Force?</h2>
                <p>
                    In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a <strong>Brute Force attack</strong>, the harder the target's password is to guess, the longer the attack will take. But if the attacker wants to find the password of his target in a short time, Social Engineering comes into play right here. If you don't know What Social Engineering is, you can check out our text <br> <a href="social-engineering.html"><b>What is Social Engineering</b></a>. Of course, you will have to use different ways in this, but if you don't know anything about your target and don't learn, unfortunately, you have no choice but to try large-scale <b>wordlists</b>. These large-scale <b>wordlists</b> can be <b>wordlists</b> with thousands, millions, or even billions of passwords.

            <h2>What's Wordlists?</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Worldlists</b> or <b>Passwordlists</b> are files with the extension txt that contain passwords used in a <b>brute-force attack</b>. You can also create these <b>wordlists</b> yourself, you can also get them from the Internet. If you want to create it yourself, you will need to do Social Engineering first for this. After collecting enough information about the target, you will need to install a tool on your system. The information you need to collect is; name, surname, date of birth, user name, etc. there may be information. The tool you need to install is the <b><a href="https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.git" target="_blank">cupp</a></b> tool. After entering personal information such as the name of the target, last name, pet's name in this tool, it will create a <b>wordlist</b> for you.

            <h2>How to protect yourself from Brute Force attacks?</h2>
            <p>
                The best way to protect yourself from <b>Brute Force</b> attacks is to set strong and unpredictable passwords.This process can delay the breaking of your password for months or even years and frustrate the attacker.
