            <h2>What's Sim Swap?</h2>
            <p>
                We can explain <strong>Sim Swap</strong> as follows; If we take the accounts that are important to you, it could be your Bitcoin account, Social Media accounts or Gaming accounts. Whichever it is, they all have an account connected to it, which is your E-mail address. This puts your E-mail address in what we might call the weakest link in the chain, so that an attacker who takes over one account can also take over other accounts linked to it.
            </p>

            <p>
                We called the E-mail address the weak link, but there is an even weaker link in the chain, which is the <strong>Phone numbers</strong> we define as the option to recover E-mail addresses. Yes, <strong>Phone numbers</strong>, which we always use to tighten security, have recently started to appear as one of the biggest weaknesses. In this attack, attackers introduce themselves as you or cooperate with the personnel by going to a GSM operator or using a communication channel. Thus, by removing a new <strong>Sim Card</strong> belonging to your number, it also captures the E-mail address that your number is defined as a recovery option and other accounts connected to this E-mail address. In order to prevent this attack, you may have to define a part of the code on your <strong>Sim Card</strong>, but the attacker can connect your <strong>Sim Card</strong> to another GSM operator and define a new code to bypass the pin code.
