            <h2>Kali Linux Main Commands</h2>
            <p>
                We have compiled the main commands of the Kali Linux system and what they do for you;
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="second-topic">
            <h2>The apt-get Command</h2>
            <p>
                The apt-get command is a command used to perform operations such as downloading, installing dependencies, upgrading, and updating new packages from defined package sources used in <strong>Linux</strong> distributions.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example;
            </p>
            <code>' apt-get update && upgrade '</code>
            <p>
                By saying so, you will be updating and upgrading your system at the same time.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="third-topic">
            <h2>The cat Command</h2>
            <p>
                The Cat command is most often used to dump the contents of a text file onto the screen. Of course, it is possible to perform this operation directly in such a way that the text itself or part of it is selected. In addition to this process, it also performs the of saving the contents of different text files to another file. If we combine it with the previous sentence, we can say that it is possible to create a new text file content from texts to be selected from different text files.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example;
            </p>
            <code>' cat file.txt '</code>
        </div>
        <div class="fourth-topic">
            <h2>The pwd Command</h2>
            <p>
                It is used to find out in which directory it is located at the time of the transaction.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="fifth-topic">
            <h2>The ls Command</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>ls</strong> command is used to show the files that exist in the directory in which we are located.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sixed-topic">
            <h2>The cd Command</h2>
            <p>
                Linux also allows us to navigate through its files. It requires either the exact location or the name of the directory, depending on the current directory you are in.For example, we need to specify which path we need to go to between these icons (/), respectively. And if so, how many levels must be returned from this directory cd .. by doing this, we can go from that directory to the previous directory. If we need to go to the root directory, we need to do cd ~.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example;
            </p>
            <code>' cd Desktop/ '</code>
        </div>
        <div class="seventh-topic">
            <h2>The mv Command</h2>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                For example;
            </p>
            <code>' mv file.txt /root/Desktop '</code>
        </div>
        <div class="eighted-topic">

            <p>
                The mkdir command is used to create a new directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example;
            </p>
            <code>' mkdir your_file '</code>
        </div>
        <div class="nineth-topic">
            <h2>The rmdir Command</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="tenth-topic">
            <h2>The rm Command</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>rm</strong> command does not need to be empty when we delete a file or to delete a directory such as the <strong>rmdir</strong> command.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example'
            </p>

        <div class="eleventh-topic">
            <h2>The sudo Command</h2>
            <p>

            <p>
                The <strong>locate</strong> command is the Decode command. If we need to explain more clearly, how we perform a search operation to find the command we want to search for on other operating systems, Linux also has more than one form of search, the <strong>locate</strong> command is one of them. when using the <strong>locate</strong> command, there is a case sensitivity to avoid this, the <strong>locate -i</strong> command is used.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example;
